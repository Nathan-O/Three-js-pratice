# Challenges

The things you read are a lie. There is a background needed to some degree to simply "Dip your toe in." to this particular realm. A background I did not have and apparently couldn't slam learn in 10(ish) hours. Bollocks!

### My Jounrey

I read through (if the browser tabs are correct) 12 different tutorials on how to make and render a cube. Completly scraped and started my code over more than a couple times. And when as far as to fork/clone the source library.

Then spent a good chunk of the night reading through the example file code/watched a video game (watched?).
